    <h1>Outer Space</h1>
    <p>So much <strong>universe</strong> and so little time</p>
    <p>
      Outer space is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and between celestial
      bodies. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard vacuum containing
      a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium,
      as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust,
      and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the
      background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (−270.45 °C;
      −454.81 °F).[1] The plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the
      baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe; it has a number density of
      less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions
      of kelvins.[2] Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars
      and galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in
      an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter
      through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces.[3][4] Observations
      suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the observable universe is
      dark energy, a type of vacuum energy that is poorly understood.[5][6]
      Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but even
      galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space. Outer
      space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface. The
      Kármán line, an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) above sea level,[7][8] is
      conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for
      aerospace records keeping. The framework for international space law was
      established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10
      October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and
      permits all states to freely explore outer space. Despite the drafting of
      UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite
      weapons have been tested in Earth orbit.
